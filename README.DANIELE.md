# `useFetch` Custom Hook Documentation

## **Description**

`useFetch` is a custom React hook that simplifies making HTTP requests. It supports multiple HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) and can handle both JSON requests and file uploads. It also supports dynamic query parameters. The hook manages the loading state, data state, and error handling, and integrates with a global context to handle loading indicators in your application.

## **Parameters**

The hook takes an object with the following parameters:

1. **`uri`** (string): The URL to send the request to (required).
2. **`method`** (string, default: `'GET'`): The HTTP method for the request. Common methods include:
   - `'GET'`: To fetch data.
   - `'POST'`: To send data to the server, often used for creating new resources.
   - `'PUT'`: To update an existing resource.
   - `'PATCH'`: To partially update an existing resource.
3. **`body`** (any, default: `null`): The payload to send in the request body. Can be an object, array, or FormData for file uploads. For non-file requests, the body is serialized into JSON.
4. **`token`** (string, default: `null`): An optional Bearer token for authorization. If provided, it will be included in the `Authorization` header.
5. **`queryParams`** (object, default: `null`): An optional object representing query parameters to append to the request URL. These parameters will be serialized into the query string.
6. **`isFileUpload`** (boolean, default: `false`): Set to `true` if you need to upload files (e.g., for an avatar or image). This will use `FormData` for sending the request body.

## **Usage Example**

To use the `useFetch` hook to update a user's avatar image, you can call it as follows:

- Example code for uploading the avatar

```js
const { data, stateLoad } = useFetch({
  uri: 'https://developer-proyect-dana.vercel.app/secure/api/v1/user',
  method: 'PUT',
  body: { avatar: selectedImage },
  token: 'token',
  isFileUpload: true
})
```

## Example Explanation

In this example:

- **The URI** is the URL where you are sending the request.
- **The method** is `'PATCH'` because you want to update the user's avatar.
- **The body** contains the avatar data (in this case, the image file).
- **The token** is your Bearer token for authorization.
- **The `isFileUpload`** is set to `true` because you are uploading an image.

### Returns

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `data`: The data returned from the server (e.g., updated user information).
- `stateLoad`: The loading state from the global context.

### Notes

- If you want to upload a file (e.g., an avatar), ensure `isFileUpload` is set to `true`.
- The body will be serialized to JSON for non-file requests, and `FormData` will be used for file uploads.

## Example: Fetching Assistance Offers with Query Parameters

To fetch assistance offers with filters, such as location-based offers for food, you can use the `useFetch` hook with query parameters. Hereâ€™s how you would set it up:

```js
const queryParams = {
  useLocation: true,
  lat: 40.7128, // Latitude of the location
  lon: -74.006, // Longitude of the location
  distance: 10, // Distance in km
  assistanceType: 'food', // Type of assistance (food)
  page: 1, // Page number for pagination
  limit: 10 // Number of results per page
}

const { data, stateLoad } = useFetch({
  uri: 'https://developer-proyect-dana.vercel.app/secure/api/v1/assistance-offer/filter',
  method: 'GET',
  queryParams: queryParams // Sending query parameters as part of the request
})
```

## Example Explanation

In this example:

- **The `uri`** is the endpoint to fetch the assistance offers.
- **The `queryParams`** are passed in the object to filter the offers by location, type of assistance, and pagination.
- The `useFetch` hook sends a GET request with the query parameters and returns the filtered data along with the loading state.

### Returns

- `data`: The filtered data (assistance offers).
- `stateLoad`: The loading state, which you can use to display a loading spinner or message.
